BUILD NOTES
-[X] Render all the Pizzas (menu) to the DOM
-[X] Make sure the images come through on the Pizzas
-[ ] Create an order object on the front end and send it to the back end
-[ ] Get the created order from the back-end and display it on the front end
-[ ] Add the functionality to cancel an order.



# MVP

1. - [X] The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.

2. - [X] The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.

3. - [X] The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least one has-many relationship. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments. (Pizza has_many :pizza_orders & has_many :orders, through: :pizza_orders, Order has_many :pizza_orders & has_many :pizzas, through: pizza_orders) 

4. - [ ] The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.
- [X] GET request to get all the PIZZAS
- [ ] POST request to create an ORDER
- [ ] GET request to retrieve the ORDER
- [ ] DELETE request to CANCEL an ORDER

# BEST PRACTICES
#### JavaScript
 - [ ] Use classes and functions to organize your code into reusable pieces.
 - [ ] Translate JSON responses into JavaScript model objects using ES6 class or constructor function syntax.
 - [ ] Use ES6 features when appropriate (e.g. arrow functions, let & const, rest and spread syntax).
#### Rails
 - [X] Follow Rails MVC and RESTful conventions. That means, for example, that a request GET /puppies ought to be handled by the PuppiesController, fetch puppies from the database using a Puppy Active Record model, and return a list of puppies as JSON.
 - [ ] Well-named variables and methods
 - [ ] Short, single-purpose methods

 
# LEARNING GOALS
#### These are the skills and knowledge that you should aim to demonstrate through the project review. 

- [ ] Explain how Rails routes a request to a controller and method based on the URL and HTTP verb
- [ ] Use render json: to render serialized JSON
- [ ] Select, Create, and Modify DOM nodes
- [ ] Attach listeners to DOM nodes to respond to user interaction
- [ ] Use preventDefault to control form submit behavior
- [ ] Use fetch with 'GET', 'POST', 'PATCH' & 'DELETE' HTTP methods
- [ ] Create a JavaScript object with ES6 class syntax
- [ ] Instantiate JavaScript objects and call methods on them.
